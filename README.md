> A non-linear, adaptive clock based around sunrise and sunset — for any location, any day of the year.

**Live site**: _coming soon (Task 012 — GitHub Pages deployment)_

## Motivation

We organize our lives around a fixed 24-hour clock. We start work at 8 or 9, finish at 4 or 5, and we do this all year round — regardless of how much daylight the day actually contains.

In the depths of winter at high latitudes, a "9-to-5" workday can consume **all** of the daylight available. The employee gives 100% of their daytime to the employer and walks home in the dark. Six months later the same nominal hours take a much smaller bite — maybe 60–70% — out of a generous summer day.

This seasonal disconnect is real, and it has measurable effects on mood, sleep, and well-being. Our usual fix — Daylight Saving Time — is a blunt one-hour, twice-a-year jolt that doesn't actually track the sun. It just shifts the misalignment around and disrupts circadian rhythms in the process.

What we actually need is a clock that **flows** with the sun: stretching and compressing through the seasons, so that the same scaled hour always represents the same fraction of available daylight, wherever and whenever you are.

That's solarflow.

## Concept

Solarflow defines two parallel time systems:

- **Linear time** — the familiar 24-hour clock. Identical regardless of season or latitude.
- **Solar time** *(working name)* — a non-linear clock anchored to the sun:
  - actual sunrise maps to **06:00**
  - actual sunset maps to **18:00**
  - daytime and nighttime are each independently stretched (or compressed) so that the mapping is continuous.

The same scaled hour always represents the same fraction of available daylight.

### Worked example

In Reykjavík on the winter solstice, the sun rises around 11:20 and sets around 15:30 — only about four hours of daylight. In solar time:

| Linear time | Solar time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 11:20 | 06:00 | Sunrise |
| 13:25 | 12:00 | Solar noon |
| 15:30 | 18:00 | Sunset |
| 09:00 | ~03:25 | "Workday start" — still deep night |
| 17:00 | ~20:25 | "Workday end" — well after sunset |

On the same day, the entire conventional workday (09:00–17:00) sits almost entirely *outside* the daylight window. Solar time makes that visible at a glance.

## Status

Early, exploratory development. The name "solar time" is provisional — suggestions welcome.

The project recently pivoted from a planned Python/FastAPI server to a **pure static SPA** deployable to GitHub Pages. All sun math runs in the browser. See [`.mdboard/tasks/`](.mdboard/tasks/) for the active roadmap.

## Tech stack

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with `@sveltejs/adapter-static` (TypeScript, strict)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling
- [`suncalc`](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) for sunrise/sunset/altitude/azimuth
- [`@photostructure/tz-lookup`](https://github.com/photostructure/tz-lookup) for IANA timezone from lat/lng (lazy-loaded)
- [`uplot`](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) for time-series charts
- Hand-rolled SVG (via Svelte components) for the bespoke clocks/timeline/sun-arc
- [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) for free-form geocoding (browser → OSM directly)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) + [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tooling

## Quickstart

```bash
mise install                  # node + pnpm + gh
mise run install              # pnpm install
mise run dev                  # SvelteKit dev server
```

Common tasks (see [`.mise.toml`](.mise.toml)):

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mise run install` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |
| `mise run dev` | SvelteKit dev server with HMR |
| `mise run build` | Build the static bundle into `build/` |
| `mise run preview` | Serve the built bundle locally |
| `mise run fmt` | Format with Prettier + ESLint |
| `mise run fmt:check` | Check formatting without modifying |
| `mise run lint` | `svelte-check` (TS + Svelte diagnostics) |
| `mise run tests` | Run Vitest |
| `mise run all` | fmt:check + lint + tests + build |

## Roadmap

Phased work is tracked as tasks in [`.mdboard/tasks/`](.mdboard/tasks/). Run `uvx mdboard` from the repo root to browse interactively.

Phases:

1. **Bootstrap** — SvelteKit + adapter-static skeleton
2. **Core math** — `suncalc` + scaling functions, fully tested
3. **Location** — presets, geolocation, geocoding, timezone lookup
4. **Visualizations** — 24h timeline, dual clocks, sun-arc, mapping curve, yearly drift
5. **Polish** — theming, responsive, accessibility
6. **Deploy** — GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages

## Reference implementation

The original Python prototype using [`astral`](https://astral.readthedocs.io/) lives at [`../solarflow-py`](../solarflow-py). It is preserved as a tested reference for the scaling math; the JS port in this repo is validated against it.

## Glossary

- **Linear time** — the standard 24-hour clock; identical regardless of season or latitude.
- **Solar time** — *(working name)* a non-linear clock for a given location and date, where actual sunrise maps to `06:00` and actual sunset to `18:00`; daytime hours and nighttime hours are independently stretched or compressed so that the same scaled hour always represents the same fraction of available daylight.
- **Solar noon** — the moment the sun is highest in the sky; always maps to solar `12:00`.
- **Linear→solar / solar→linear** — the two directions of the mapping. The forward direction answers "what is the solar time right now?"; the inverse answers questions like "what linear time is solar 09:00?"
